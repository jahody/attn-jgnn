# SATLIB Benchmark Configuration
# Open-source dataset with CNF formulas from various distributions

name: satlib
data_dir: ${paths.data_dir}/satlib

# Five categories used in the paper
categories:
  - rnd3sat    # Uniform random 3-SAT on phase transition region
  - bms        # Backbone-minimal random 3-SAT
  - cbs        # Random 3-SAT with controlled backbone size
  - gcp        # "Flat" graph coloring
  - sw_gcp     # "Morphed" graph coloring

# Minimum instances required per category
min_instances_per_category: 100

# Variable count filtering
variable_range:
  min: 100
  max: 600

# Total expected instances: 46,200
total_instances: 46200

# Train/validation/test split
split_ratio:
  train: 0.6
  val: 0.2
  test: 0.2

# Random seed for reproducible splits
seed: 42

# Label solver configuration
label_solver:
  name: dsharp
  timeout: 5000  # seconds per instance

# Tree decomposition configuration
tree_decomposition:
  tool: flowcutter
  timeout: 300  # seconds

# Graph representation settings
graph:
  feature_dim: 64
  use_join_graph: true  # Use join-graph structure from tree decomposition

# Dataset characteristics (for reference)
# - All instances are satisfiable
# - Only satisfiable instances with at least 100 instances per distribution used
